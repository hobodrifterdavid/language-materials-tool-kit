you know l hate to be alone .
yes . bathing is a lonely business .
except for fish .
l beg your pardon ?
did you say ''except for fish '' ?
fish all bathe together .
although they do tend
to eat one another .
l often think . . .
. . .fish must get
awfully tired of seafood .

pardon me . . . .
l do n't want you to be alone .
l 'll never be alone .
l have you .

there are many pictures .
look how nobody ever smiles here .
why does n't anybody ever smile here ?
they smile at lunchtime .
lower your voice , arthur .
and sit up .
stop being so nervous .
later on , we 'll get ice cream .
your father will see you now .
come on , hobson .
he wants to see you alone .
he gets all that money .
pays his family back
by being a stinking drunk .
lt 's enough to make you sick .
l really would n't know , sir .
l 'm just a servant .
on the other hand . . .
. . .go screw yourself .
the press has a good time
with you , arthur .
''millionaire drunk playboy. ''
you 're the weakest man
l 've ever known !
l despise your weakness !
l 'm afraid we have to talk .
l 'm not going to marry her !
l 've told you a thousand times !
fine . lf that 's your decision ,
the family has no choice .
l 'm sorry , arthur , very sorry .
but as of this moment , you are . . .

l 'd rather starve .
and l will .
l 'll get married when
l fall in love .
fine . l respect your integrity .
you 've just lost
750 million dollars .
actually , susan is
a very nice girl .
and she 'll make a wonderful wife .
yes , wonderful .
have you ever seen her face . . .

catches it just right ?
she 's really quite beautiful .
of course , you ca n't depend
on that light .
the wedding is a month from today .
the invitations will be
mailed tonight .

she does spectacular
things with a chicken .
and l love a chicken made at home .
this is the ring your grandfather
gave to your grandmother .
she wants you to
give it to susan .
this is to marry one girl ?
do n't do this to me .
l 've been waiting for you
to grow up . l ca n't wait any longer .
congratulations , father , you win .
l had every intention of winning .
congratulations to you , arthur .
you 're going to be wealthy
for the rest of your life .
that 's all l 've ever wanted to be .
l 'll take three dozen of these shirts .
assorted colors .
l hate my father .
then purchase four dozen .
four dozen .
and l want . . .
. . . 1 4 of these sweaters , all green .
all green ?
l do n't wear sweaters .
send them to
my address , will you ?
what else can l buy , hobson ?
hobson ! did you see that ? !
she stole that tie !
lt 's a perfect crime !
girls do n't wear ties .
although some do . lt 's not a perfect
crime , but it 's a good crime .
lf she murdered the tie
it 'd be a perfect crime .
why are you so happy
about all this ?
the man following her
is a security guard .
we 've got to be calm !
ls n't she beautiful ? jesus !
may l ask what have
we to do with this ?
l beg your pardon , miss .
l 'm the security guard
in the store .
you do n't need the badge .
no customer would
wear that jacket .
l must look in the bag .
l saw you put something in it .
you got trouble , mister .
you 'll never work on the east coast
again . what 's your name ?
she 's sensational !
she does have a certain
eleanor roosevelt quality .

the address , chester !
l 'm not fooling !
l saw you put a tie in that bag !
what did you say ? !
all right , that 's it !
l want a cop !
get me a cop !
we need a cop here !
do n't move from where you are .
l do n't want you out of my sight !
get me a cop !
get your hands off me .
l 'm arthur bach .
l 'll straighten this out .
mr. bach , you really should
stay out of this .
well , he 's in it , chester .
tell him , alfred .
l know this woman .
we 're shopping together .
where the hell have you been ?
l 'm sorry darling .
l got caught up .
she 's a friend , mr. bach ?
he just said that , chester .
you 're such a schmuck .
l asked her to pick out a tie .
l was going to put it on my bill .
you did n't pay for it ?
l forgot . l 'm sorry .
chester , what can l say ?
l had no idea .
may l look at the tie ?
oh , god , that 's really lovely .
l hope you like it .
you 're really wonderful .
not in front of
all these people , dear .
they might think you 're an animal .
mr. bach , you understand ,
it 's my job .
would you ask the lady at
the counter to put this on my bill ?
l 'll take care of it , mr. bach .
thank you very much .
were you scared ?
why are you smiling
at me like that ?
l see .
you 're a little strange . . .
. . .but cute .

l 'll go to the bus stop now .
why did you steal that tie ?
l do n't know .
l 'm a wonderful person !

he 's getting on my nerves .

at me like that ?
you look like
one of santa 's helpers .

my name is arthur ,
and this is mr. hobson .
good afternoon .
good afternoon ?
my name is linda .
l 'd like to thank you very much .
you did a nice thing .
that was an interesting kiss .
you kiss your wife like that ?
l 'm not married .
keep smiling . 688-5549 .
do n't expect big things
on the first date .
yes , it 's been a distinct
pleasure meeting you .
arthur , we really must be going .
thank you for
a memorable afternoon .
usually one must go to a bowling alley
to meet a woman of your stature .
would n't it be funny
if he called me ?
arthur , l see no reason
for prolonging this conversation .
unless you 're planning . . .
. . .to knock over a fruit stand
later in the evening .
good luck in prison .
who was the tie for ?
a guy .
look how he stopped smiling .
my father . lt 's his birthday .
what are you doing tomorrow night ?
l do n't know .
l have plans for tomorrow night .
what should l wear ?
steal something casual .
l like him .
likewise , l 'm sure .
l 'll have bitterman
drive you home .
you do n't have to do that .
bitterman does n't
have to take me .
l really hardly ever
take the bus , ever .
but it 's so hard to get a cab .
of course .
l 'm sure we know a lot
of the same people .
get in .
right .
tell bitterman where to take you .
and make sure . . .
. . .you give him your address
and phone number .
take care of her , bitterman .
good afternoon !
you 'd think they 'd never
seen a car before .
hey lady , where
did you get the car ?
could you children please
allow us our privacy ?
could l sit here until
one of my neighbors walks by ?
l want someone l know
to see me get out of this .
l understand .
here comes mrs. nesbit .
this should kill her .
do n't touch the door .
l 'll do it .
mrs. nesbit deserves
the entire treatment .
thank you , bitterman .
well , hello , mrs. nesbit !
will that be all , madam ?
l think so .
have a nice evening , mrs. nesbit .
could be a big tie .
lt is a tie .
then guessing would be
out of the question .
lt is a tie !
surprise !
l love it !
lt goes with everything l own .
l hope you like it .
lf l do n't get a job soon , you may
get it back on your birthday .
dad , shut up .
a funny thing happened
to me today .
do you know why . . .
. . .girls marry so badly ?
ls this a joke ?
are these polish girls ?
the reason is , there
are so many girls . . .
. . .and so few princes .
you met a prince ?
l met a nice guy . with my help ,
he could become a prince .
who is he ?
just a guy .
what does he do ?
nothing .
another beauty .
how does he make a living ?
look , l have to make dinner .
l take it this bum
will be calling you .
dad , he 's a millionaire .
you have my permission
to marry him .

she 'll drop dead . she 'll love them .
yellow roses . two dozen .
l think something else
would look nice too .
red roses . with the yellow .
she wo n't know what hit her !
you 'll be aces with her .
you 're a nice boy .
two dozen red , okay ?
do you know what happened ?
no , l do n't .
yesterday l met her
outside bergdorf 's .
l ca n't stop
thinking about her !

what 's that ?
a yucca plant .
l 'll take it .

four .
where were you
when l was selling cars ?
how did you know
when you fell in love ?
how does anybody know ?

a girl got on the train .
skinny . she gave me a smile .
by baltimore , l was a dead duck .
did you whistle a lot ?
l find l whistle !
l whistled .

you 're the rich one ?
the one who drinks ?
how does it feel
to have all that money ?
lt feels great .
a dumb question .
what do you do ?
l 've never asked .
l 'm an actress .
l mean , l 'm studying to be one .
but l 'm working as a waitress .
a lot of talented girls do that .
what 's it like being a waitress ?
lt 's fun . l mean , you know .
this guy came in and pulled out-
a guy came into the diner
and pulled out-
he pulled out what ?

l love this song !
l love it too !
when do l get a turn ?
ca n't you see l 'm going
for a new world 's record ?
after only 1 2 games ,

l knew it would be different
spending an evening with a millionaire .
two more and l 'm 20 for 20 !
that 's another 35 coupons !
could we have a little quiet here ?
you nut !
look at him with his gun .
are you cute !

on my mother 's side .
arthur .

but if you got sick , or anything . . .
. . .l 'd take care of you .
then l 'll get sick .
this vermeer just arrived today .

the dealer jerked me around
on the price a little .
but what the hell .
we live once .
martha . . . .
what 's the matter , arthur ?
l ca n't marry susan johnson .
really ?
l met this girl !
you are a charming boy .
unfortunately . . .
. . .every time you have an erection ,
it makes the papers .
goodness !
l sound like a dime novel .
peanuts !
ls n't my grandson handsome , harriet ?
yes .
thank you , harriet .
ls it wonderful to be . . .
. . .promiscuous ?
at your age , martha ,
it might just be dangerous .
who is she ? this one you met .
l do n't know .
she lives in queens .
she 's nobody .
but there 's something
about her , martha .
make no mistakes .
you are too old to be poor .
you do n't know how .
we are ruthless people .
do n't screw with us .
arthur , l love you .
lf you do n't marry susan
l 'll cut you off without a cent .
you 're a scary old broad , martha .
and you are a delightful child .
marry susan and cheat
with the nobody from queens .
how are you ?
l got off work early .
listen , do you like lasagna ?
yeah .
oh , thank god .
l know this is last minute . . .
. . .but something came up .
l ca n't make it tonight .
fine . no problem . what ?
listen , the truth is . . .
. . .l 'm getting engaged tonight .
the easiest thing would be
to lie , but l like you-
look , no sweat .
we had some laughs . good luck . . . .
l wanted to tell you
the other night , but l-
do n't worry about it .
l have to go . okay ? bye .
would you like a beer ?
l 'll get you a beer .
l 'll be all right , sweetheart .
l just have to be
alone for a minute .
oh , god ! l ca n't bear it .
come in .
shall l get the car , mr. bach ?
no thanks , bitterman .
tonight l 'll drive myself .
how often does
a young man get engaged ?
where 's mr. hobson ?
mr. hobson was tired , sir .
he 's resting .
he 's been tired
quite a bit lately .
l 'm sure he 's fine , sir .
will you cut it out ?
l did n't mean to tell you ,
but l 've got a tumor .
did the lights go off ?
just talk to me , okay ?
with a tumor in my head ?
listen , arthur .
there are three books . . . .
this is important .
take them back . . .
. . .to the library .
do n't die anymore .
lt 's getting very boring .
l 've only got a cold .
now go and get engaged .
l just told linda
l was getting engaged .
l do n't know why .
a tart like that could
save you a fortune in prostitutes .
listen , old man .
do n't ever talk about
her that way again .
she 's the best person l know !
goddamn it ,
why are you such a snob ? !
l raised my voice to you .
l 've never done that before .
that 's quite all right .
you know , you may be growing up .
and l 'm sorry for what
l said about linda .
do you want anything ?
l want to be younger .
l 'm sorry .
lt 's your job to be older .
good evening , mr. bach .
good evening , mr. butler .
l 'm here to get engaged .
wo n't you come in , sir ?
how are you ?
susan ! you get down here
this minute !
miss susan is expecting you .
she 's dressing .
l will inform her you 're here .
tell her chief lnspector flanigan
from homicide is here .
that should get her
down in a hurry .
nothing . offer to take my coat .
you do n't have a coat .
well , offer to take my tie .
lt 's a little joke .
take the rest of the week off .
you 're obviously
under a lot of tension .
would you care to wait
in the library ?
yes ! the bathroom is
out of the question !
that 's another little joke .
follow me , please .
l 'm a little nervous .
l 'm getting engaged .
you may wait in here .
thank you !
ls there anything you
care for while you wait ?
do you have today 's pravda ?
l like to keep up with russia .
then fill a glass with scotch .
are you sure you want
to be a nightclub comic ?
marty , he 's pouring a drink .
l 'll get back to you !
lf you 're going to be like that ,
let 's call the whole thing off !
god , these people !
l 'm glad we had this time together .
you 're a funny guy .
you have that trouble too ?
this must be awfully
embarrassing for you .
hello , arthur .
hello , mr. johnson .
l have n't seen you lately .
the reason you have n't
seen me is because . . .
. . .l normally pick susan up
at her apartment in town .
and you live here .
want a drink ?
l never drink .
no one in my family drinks .
that 's great !
you probably never run out
of ice your whole life .
l do n't drink because drinking
affects your decision-making .
you may be right .
l ca n't decide .
that 's just a little humor .
where 's the rest
of this moose ?
arthur , l think it 's time
we got to know one another .
l do too . that 's why
l had you come over today .
this is a tough room .
l do n't have to tell you that .
you must have hated this moose .
why do n't you forget
the moose for a moment ? !
right .
you know . . .
. . .l did n't inherit money
like you did .
l started with nothing .
and yet . . .
. . .l was a millionaire
by the time l was 1 8 .
anyone stood in my way ,
they got hurt .
when l was 1 1 years old . . .
. . .l killed a man .
when you 're 1 1 , you do n't even
know there 's a law against that .
ls susan here ?
l knew what l was doing .
we were poor .
he came into our house
to steal our food .
well , he was asking for it .
l took a knife . . .
. . .and l killed him
in the kitchen .
you probably ate out that night .
l mean , with that man
lying in your kitchen .
you seem to find humor in everything .
yes , sorry .
arthur !
what ?
do you know what l consider to be
my most precious possession ?
my daughter .
she is my gold .
she is my treasure .
she 's very nice .
and l protect what 's mine .
and l do it in an ugly way .
l 'm from the gutter .
l understand . the gutter .
you seem upset .
now , susan loves you .
and l want you to make her happy .
you can count on it .
l insist upon you making her happy .
listen .
what happens . . .
. . .this is just hypothetical . . .
. . .if l do n't make her happy ?
which is out of the question !
but let 's just say . . .
. . .l make her . . .
. . .cranky ?
for cranky , l guess you 'd
probably just break my ankles .
something like that .
you 'll make her happy .
l do n't like your drinking .
lt makes you unreasonable .
l want you to go to work .
now , your father and l
talked about it . l want you . . .
. . .to work for me .

in the morning to say goodbye ?
l have to get up and go to work
in the morning . stop kidding around !
will you stop kissing me !
l 'm sure you 're not going
to want to be a waitress . . .
. . .for the rest of your life .
l am studying to be an actress .
you told me .
well , l am .
this is for you . . .
. . .your father . . .
. . .and your acting career .

arthur 3
do you know the worst part ?
the worst part of being me ?
l should imagine your breath .
let me be unhappy , will you ?
you know , hobson . . .
. . .l could love somebody .
l never got to love anybody !
what do l have to live for ?
l 'm a failure . l 'm just in the way .
would you remove your helmet , please ?

please .
thank you .
now your goggles .

you spoiled little bastard !
you 're a man who has everything .
but that 's not enough .
you feel unloved ? welcome to
the world . everyone is unloved !
stop feeling sorry for yourself .
and incidentally , l love you .
marry susan , arthur .
poor drunks do not find love .
poor drunks have very few teeth .
they urinate outdoors .
they freeze to death in summer .
l ca n't bear to think
of you that way .
l need linda , hobson .
l see .
well , perhaps fate
will lend a hand , arthur .
one never knows .
good afternoon ?
may l come in ?
lf you and your undershirt
would walk two paces backwards . . .
. . .l could enter this dwelling .
how revolting .
look who 's here .
the british tonto .
how are you ? how 's arthur ?
ever since l met arthur ,
l liked him .
we have to make sure these
two wonderful kids stay together .
who is this person ?
he 's my father .
yes , and l 'd like to say that --
try not to speak .
would you get me a cup of tea ?
l wish to speak to linda .
sure .
there is an engagement
party tonight . . .
. . .at arthur 's father 's house
in southampton .
here is the address .
perhaps you should attend .
are all the ones
he passed up coming ?
young woman , this is a tie
you can not steal !
this is a tie you 'll have
to work for .
are you inviting me
to arthur 's engagement party ?
this is not an invitation .
however . . .
. . .if there 's one thing that
old gentlemen can still do . . .
. . .they can still spot
young gentlemen in love .
please go to the party .
are you all right ?
yes , l 'm fine .
does arthur know you 're here ?
no , arthur is far too fine
a person to be involved . . .
. . .in something as devious as this .
you really look out for him ,
do n't you ?
and it is a job
that l recommend highly .
l have something for you .
for me ?
what is it ?
lf l told you ,
it would spoil the surprise .
do n't open it .
here 's your tea .
l despise tea .
would you bring me 2 aspirin
from the bathroom ?
you 'll find them on the top shelf ,
behind the untouched shaving cream .
that sounds bad .
have you seen a doctor ?
yes .
and he has seen me .
you know . . .
. . .l think arthur has
a very good friend .
may l kiss you on the cheek ?
ls it something you feel
strongly about ?
what about your aspirins ?
the aspirins are for you , my dear .
hello .
good evening .
god knows when l 'll see you again .
arthur , will you play
something for us ?
do n't you hate these things ?
despise them .
actually , seriously . . .
. . .songs come and go .
but l love the classics .
and l hope you 'll enjoy this one .
you 'd better watch out
you 'd better not cry
are you good friends with arthur ?
for ages .
l 'm so pleased he finally found
the right woman . where is she ?
over there .
ls n't she just beautiful ?
of course she is .
why would arthur marry a dog ?
pardon ?
santa claus is coming to town
how does it feel to be
getting married ?
blue moon
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
thanks a lot . that 's flattering .
lf you knew susan
like l knew susan
l need a drink !
tell me your entire name , darling .
preston langly .
really ! lf you do n't remember
when we met , l mean , honestly !
put your arm around me .
of course .
linda , you 're here .
so true .
join us .
congratulations .
father sends his regards .
does he ?
yes , he does .
wednesday night may be
difficult for me .
what ?
you 're looking wonderful , my dear .
are n't l ? thank you .
wednesday ?
lt 's difficult for her
that night , preston .
ls n't that the night you usually
attend the ballet , darling ?
actually , l feel foolish ,
but l do n't recall ever making-
would you be divine and
get me a gin and tonic ?
scotch for me , preston .
you wait here for me ?
lf it takes forever .
what are you doing here . . .
. . .and why are you talking like that ?
l was in the neighborhood .
lt took me two buses ,
three cabs and a train . . .
. . .to get into the neighborhood .
but what the hell ?
nice place . l like a living room
you can land a plane in .
there 's more of it . you like a tour ?
l 've seen bedrooms .
do n't be a lover . be a person .
make me happy .
her name is linda marolla .
she 's the one arthur saw
the other night . she lives in queens .
mario , please !
do n't worry . l talked to the warden .
we 'll get you out of here .
when l was a kid , l used to open
their stalls and let them run out .
you should have been there
the day l freed my goldfish .
come over here .
l want you two to meet .
pancho , this is linda .
l told you about her , remember ?
lt must have been something ,
growing up with all this .
l was away at boarding school
most of the time .
l was kicked out of ten prep schools .
l was a bad kid .
no , you were n't .
you just wanted to go home .
bad kids do n't grow up
as nice as you .
why do you think pancho loves you ?
thank you .
this is kind of like prom night ,
is n't it ?
l mean , we 're all dressed up .
have you ever been in love ?
you ?
but when l was little ,
l thought the moon followed me .
what ?
l would walk and l thought
the moon went anyplace l did .
that 's great !
l know it 's silly ,
but l was only eight years old .
l thought it meant something special
would happen to me someday .
so l 've been waiting . every day l 've
been doing my hair , and washing . . .
. . .my face --
can l kiss you ?
please .
l was n't talking to you .
why is it you can make me laugh
at the saddest times in my life ?
l 'm funny , that 's why .
l 'm funny !
yeah , that 's it .
you 're going to marry susan .
l 'm still glad l came here .
made a fool out of myself .
l wish we had made love .
l 'd give anything
to see you in the morning .
l have to marry susan .
lf l do n't , my family will cut me off .
lt 's almost a billion dollars .
one of the horses just fainted .
look , this is ridiculous .
you got cab fare to the city ?
l do n't like the train at night .
look , when susan and l
get married . . .
. . .l can set you up in an apartment
and we can-
forget it .
are you cute !
l thought l 'd find you here .
he just loves that smelly old horse .
have we met ?
l do n't think you have .
linda marolla ,
this is susan johnson , my fiancée .
l hope l 'm not interrupting .
l 'd say that if l were you .
we might as well tell her .
you tell her .
my husband , harold ,
went to prep school with arthur .
harold lost a fortune gambling .
he 's sick !
he 's a sick man !
but he 's my husband .
l 'm not one of your guests .
l came for one reason .
l came here to beg arthur
to lend us some money .
one of my kids . . .
. . .my youngest , my baby . . .
. . .needs an operation .
harold has n't kept up the insurance .
l do n't know where to turn !
do l have to go on ?
no , of course not !
of course not !
arthur , l was n't spying on you .
l know that !
there 's an urgent phone call
for you from bitterman .
thank you .
say hello to harold for me .
you all right , bitterman ?
yes , sir .
would you like me to get you
some scotch , sir ?
we 'll get through this together .
lt 's very hard .
l 'm glad to have you here , sir .
bitterman , do me a favor .
go back to the house .
phone my father and mr. johnson and
miss susan . tell them what 's happened .
the wedding will have to wait .
and bring me back some clothes here .
okay , let 's open the presents .
l 'm sorry , arthur .
for what ?
for leaving you .
you 're not leaving anyone .
why , it 's a basketball !
what the hell ?
l knew you did n't have one .
lf l feel the urge to dribble . . .
. . .l can always call the nurse .
l 'll put this over here .
you purchased a choo-choo ?
look , the wheels go round .
l 'm very pleased .
do you remember . . .
. . .when you used to play
hide-and-seek with me ?
l used to hide and
you never found me !
did you know l never looked ?
come on !
well , l looked a little .
one for you , one for me .
put it on .
l do n't wish to put it on .
l 'll put it on .
lf l begin to die ,
please take this off my head .
this is n't how
l wish to be remembered .
are n't they great ?
l 've got guns and
holsters too . look .
just in town for supplies , partner .
arthur , l 'm frightened .
l know you 're frightened .
l 'm going to take care of you .
good morning , mr. bach .
hi , ken .
here , l 'll take that .
you look terrible .
you have n't slept in a week .
well , we had a bad night .

l 'll get fired .
no , you wo n't .
listen .
for lunch . . .
. . .l want the trout almondine
from lutêce . tell henri it 's for me .
he should n't eat that .
l do n't want his last meal
to be jell-o .
thanks very much . see you later .
look who 's up .
we have eggs , we have kippers .
we have croissants .
we have a yellow rose .
we have strawberries .
we have blueberry cakes .
we have orange juice
and great coffee .

. . .l 'm very glad you 're here .
l want you to eat this .
this is costing me .
l 've got chefs working at six
in the morning all over town .
you look awful .
that 's because you 've never
seen me sober . now eat .
come on . you used to make me eat .
lt 's not so bad .
you do n't need to be
so frightened about it .
what ?
dying .
seems natural .
even comforting , now .
you 're even teaching me
how to die ?
l 'm through teaching you anything .
you 've grown up .
you can do anything
with your life that you want to .
what do you mean ?
figure it out .
you seen linda marolla lately ?
linda marolla ?
why would you ask about her ?
l do n't know what l 'm talking about .
l 'm dying .
want me to read you shakespeare ?
hamlet was in big trouble
when we left off .
no .
you 're a good son .
you take your average kid today .
he do n't want to go in the army .
yeah , what does he care ? dope !
but the communists ,
they go in the army !
lf only we had some communists here .
no .
while our kids are dancing . . .
. . .their kids are learning
how to fight !
everybody 's dancing here !
you 're right . you 're right .
lt 's not worth talking about .
let me buy you another drink .
right .
what do you do ?
l 'm a dance instructor .
no , l 'm kidding . l 'm kidding !
honest to god .
l 'm a dentist .
l hate dentists .
we 're not bad guys .
lt 's not easy , you know .
there 's teeth and gums and blood !
oh , my god !
l have to get looped
just to walk into my office .
bartender !
we would like two more , please .
have n't you had enough ?
l want more than enough .
how come you got all this
money for all these drinks ?
l saved my money .
l have n't had a drink in a month .
oh , my god !
well , you see , my father died .
so l stayed sober .
one night at the hospital . . .
. . .he fell asleep .
l was watching him .
and then . . .
. . .he just kept on sleeping .
and l was all alone .
oh , that 's terrible .
listen . . .
. . .l was lucky to know him at all .
are you somebody 's father ?
no , l 'm a drunk .
l have a brother
who moved to new jersey .
l 'm getting married soon .

l do n't love her .
l do n't love her !

. . .in love with another woman .

l 'm in love with another woman .
l 'm in love . . .
. . .with another . . .
. . .woman !
susan , the one innocent . . .
. . .person in all of this has been you .
l 'm really sorry .
shut up , arthur ! just shut up !
daddy !
hello , mr. johnson !
he must be nervous .
arthur gets nervous .
here 's your ring , arthur .
l hope you 're happy .
now , stand up , son , l want
to kill you with my bare hands .
l think you know everyone .
this is susan 's father .
my god ! arthur , you 're really hurt !
l 've got him right
where l want him .
you animal !
look , it 's over !
he does n't love your daughter .
l 'm sorry . lt happens .
he loves me .

harold ?
you poor thing .
stand aside .
now , is this the slut that
you 've disgraced my daughter for ? !
slut ? !
slut ? !
please , daddy !
daddy , he 's not worth it .
just sit up .
can you move , arthur ?
everybody out !
out ! all of you , out !
god !
he 's taking the knife
out of the cheese !
do you think he wants
some cheese ?
no , l think we 're going to die !
what 's going on here ?
stop that this instant !
do n't screw with me , burt !
ladies and gentlemen . . .
. . .l 'm sorry .
as you probably have surmised by now . . .
. . .there will be no wedding .
the bride . . .
. . .has had second thoughts . . .
. . .and has decided . . .
. . .not to marry me .
most of you know me .
can you blame her ?
l wo n't be seeing most of you
anymore because . . .
. . .l 'm going to be . . .
. . .poor .
l 'll miss you .
now there 's a good . . .
. . .chance l should go . . .
. . .to the hospital .
this has some iodine on it ,
so it might hurt a little .
that hurts , l hate it ! stop it !
why did you do that ?
because l hate an infection !
lf you 'd have just
let me get-
look , as long as we 're here . . . .
do you promise to love me . . .
. . .and obey me ?
and be a good boy ?
l do .
and do you promise never to put
that stuff on my face again ?
l do .
god !
we 're going to be great !
we 're going to be like . . .
. . .one of those poor couples
on the subway who hold hands .
how much is the subway ?
sixty cents . but if you spit ,
it 's a $ 500 fine .
then l wo n't spit .
good ! none of the best people do .
l 'll get a job !
that 's what l 'll do !
l 'll get a job !
l 'll work !
god , this 'll be great !
good ! look how excited he is .
l 'll come home from work .
you 'll be ironing .
we 'll eat some cheap ,
disgusting food .
stop !
l think we 're in trouble .
that is out of the question !
there has never been such a thing
as a working-class bach !
and there never will be !
step ! step !
l 've reached a decision .
the bach family must endure .
and not on a subway .
your children will be
senators , ambassadors .
perhaps even a president !
you have your 750 million dollars .
all right !
l do n't know , martha .
you do n't know ? !
money has screwed me up my whole life .
l know !
l 've always been rich
and never been happy .
l 've always been poor
and usually been happy .
rubbish ! l 've always been rich
and l 've always been happy .
would you make me
a tuna fish sandwich ?
l 'm going to have
a tuna fish sandwich , martha .
step .
l demand that you take this money .
l want a decision
and l want it now !
l ca n't tell you what a lousy
wedding that was , bitterman .
bitterman , goodbye .
l 'm going .
goodbye , sir .
lt was a pleasure working for you .
chauffeurs rarely get to laugh .
thank you .
goodbye , bitterman .
goodbye , miss .
arthur , l 'm going !
open that door , rockland !
ever been on a yacht ?
no , is it wonderful ?
lt does n't suck .
l shall never offer you
this money again .
l wish you luck in your poverty .
excuse me .
what happened ?
l turned her down .
she invited us for dinner
and l said . . .
. . .we 're having a tuna fish sandwich .
so l turned her down .
l took the money , l mean ,
l 'm not crazy !
do you want to double your salary ?
then open that door .
right away , sir .
ls that funny ?
where to , sir ?
the park . drive through the park .
you know how l love the park .
get in ! step !
step !
