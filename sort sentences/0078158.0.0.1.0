nice landing , uncle bene .
right on the 50-yard line .
should 've gone for a touchdown .
next time , i 'll put it
right between the goalposts .
ca n't wait to see the museums
and go to all the concerts .
that 's why we arranged
this little vacation .
we 've been so busy establishing
our community on witch mountain
that you two have n't had
an opportunity
to see what life
in the big city is all about .
i 'd rather go to the beach
and learn how to surf .
there 'll be
another time for that .
just remember what i told you ,
and have a lot of fun .
it 's locked .
tia ?
tony , come back here .
now , never energize unless
it 's absolutely necessary .
tia ?
if earth kids can live here
without energizing , you can too .
you the party
i 'm supposed to pick up ?
just the children .
all right .
meter 's running , hop in .
i got it .
i 've been waiting here forever .
you know , people wait for taxis ,
not taxis wait for people .
we 're exactly on time .
yeah , well , kind of a
strange time and place
to be making a pick up .
i mean , if you 're here for the
next game , it 's in three months .
we have seats
on the 50-yard line .
deliver the children
to this address .
you 'll be paid after you arrive .
this is a big fare here .
if these kids pay me , i hope
they know i get a big tip .
now , everything 's been arranged .
i 'll see you friday .
ok. goodbye , uncle bene .
goodbye .
have fun , you two .
look at that dummy .
get off the road , you dummy .
these civilians
do n't know how to drive .
they ought to be
kept off the streets .
the streets belong
to us professional drivers .
taxis , buses , trucks .
that 's all that should
be allowed on the streets .
you see , i happen to know
a great deal about driving .
i have a perfect safety record .
come on , get out
of the way , you bum .
thank you . thank you , sickle .
well , this is a perfect test site .
little traffic ...
... and low real estate value .
it 's adequate , i suppose .
ok , let 's get this over with .
this thing on all right ?
it 's ready .
what do you want him
to do this time ?
i want you to
climb that fire escape ...
... to the absolute top .
wait a minute .
this is as high as i go .
you want me to
break somebody 's leg ?
just tell me how many pieces .
but up there , i do n't go .
why not ?
because i 'm afraid of heights .
i will get dizzy . i will fall .
that is true , victor .
he has acrophobia ...
... among other things .
find a different test for him .
acrophobia is not
a problem with my device .
start climbing .
i will do anything else you say ,
but i am not going
up that building , understand ?
i ...
sickle ...
... i command you
to climb up that fire escape .
you will go to the very top ,
you will turn around ,
and you will look down .
and you will not
be frightened of heights .
off you go .
it 's working .
it 's working !
it seems to be .
victor . victor ,
you are risking his life .
he 's my nephew .
my only living relative .
he 's the only one
i can leave my ...
... my bankruptcy to .
that 's what experimentation
is all about , letha .
we can not afford to lose him .
i am the only one
we can not afford to lose .
ca n't you see that i 've got
complete control over his mind ?
he has no fear ,
no memory , no will .
he can only carry out my commands .
what ... what 's happening ?
we 're out of gas .
what are you , crazy ? look at
the dial , it points to ... empty .
empty ?
it was all that waiting
i had to do for youse .
i 'll run down the street to the
gas station and get some gas .
boy , oh , boy .
you guys are costing me
a lot of dough .
i sure hope you
make the tip worth it .
something 's going to happen
to someone near here .
we 've got to help .
no , i think you 'd better stay
here and wait for the driver .
i 'll go .
i think it came from
back that way .
be careful .
and remember what uncle bene said .
that is enough . bring him down !
sickle , turn to your right .
balance yourself
and walk along the ledge .
victor , no . stop .
i 'll bring him down myself .
give that to me .
look what you 've done .
sickle , stop .
sickle , i 'm commanding you to stop .
sickle , this is dr. victor
gannon commanding you to stop !
he 's out of control .
sickle !
go back !
sickle !
no !
letha ... look .
i ca n't look .
you must .
it 's miraculous .
there are no miracles , letha .
only scientific explanations
for everything .
well , then , just explain to me
what we 're seeing .
it ... must be ...
... that ... boy .
there 's a ...
there 's a force that ...
... centers around that boy .
a force capable
of countermanding
the basic physical law of ...
gravity .
victor , i do n't know
what you 're talking about .
molecular mobilization .
i need that boy , letha .
i need him desperately .
now , just a minute .
brilliant , my boy . brilliant .
congratulations , young man ,
for a fantastic ...
well , whatever it was
you just did ,
it was absolutely heroic .
it was nothing , i just ...
get off the street !
run !
hide !
here come the goon goons !
let 's get 'em !
they run like chickens .
more goons !
we 're trapped !
hide or they 'll get ya .
over here .
it ai n't no use
hiding behind those trash cans .
the earthquakes '
got girls in their gang .
let 's finish 'em .
now , where
in the world did that come from ?
it was a set up .
let 's give it to 'em .
yeah .
that was an ambush !
stop banging into me .
i ca n't see .
i ca n't get out .
get me out . get it off me .
yeah ! all right !
hey , you really saved us
from getting wiped out .
yeah , thanks a lot .
what 's your name ?
tia .
i 'm rocky .
i 'm muscles .
crusher .
and i 'm dazzler .
we 're the earthquake gang .
does that scare you ?
no .
let 's change our name again .
we got ta have a name that scares .
yeah .
how 'd you do what you done ?
well , i really
did n't do anything .
yeah . you a magician
or something ?
no .
you want to join our gang ?
i 'm sorry .
i 'm looking for someone .
thanks anyway .
aw , sure .
i guess you 're like
the rest of them .
you 've heard we 're a nothing gang .
yeah , well we ai n't
always gon na be nothing .
someday we 're gon na
be the toughest .
take over the whole territory .
someday they 're gon na run when
they see us coming down the block .
all right .
it 's just that
i 've got to find my brother .
what gang does he belong to ?
he does n't belong to any gang .
i never heard of a guy
that never belonged to a gang .
i 'm sure something 's happened .
i 've got to find him .
if anybody could find him , we could .
i mean , we know
this town inside out .
oh , would you ?
hey , yeah , sure .
listen , you done us a big favor ,
now we 'll do it for you .
thank you . thank you very much .
hey , come on , let 's go .
that tony sure made himself scarce .
we better walk you home .
where do you live ?
i ... i was supposed to
stay at a hotel .
but i do n't know which one .
you could stay in our hideout .
yeah !
thank you .
we 'll look for tony tomorrow .
if we are n't busy
beating up goons .
yeah .
hey , it 's yo-yo .
get down .
come on , hide .
did he see us ?
i do n't know .
but he 's coming this way .
who is he ?
our worst enemy .
he 's worse than the goons .
he 's mr. yokomoto ,
the truant officer .
he 's trying to make us
go back to school .
let 's go .
that 's our hideout .
when do the ghosts get here ?
do n't say things like that .
this place could really scare ya .
come on .
this is where we 're gon na live
when we run away from home .
yeah , you ca n't be tough
if you take orders from
your mom or older sister .
that 's why we quit school .
you ca n't be tough
and educated , too .
tony !
where ?
i had a contact with him .
you ...
you calling on the spirits ?
she 's weird .
she 's creepy .
i ... i ai n't too sure
i wan na meet this tony .
tony , where are you ?
he 's coming in again .
i can only see a light .
that 's all .
now it 's ... going black .
now it 's ... completely gone .
he 's doing that ?
he 's projecting a magnetic field
through his reflexes
as he struggles
to regain consciousness .
his output is so great ,
that my machines are n't
even capable of measuring it .
but he 's dangerous .
once i have control
of his brain , letha ,
he will only
be dangerous to others .
i hope you realize that
kidnapping 's a criminal offense .
my experiments are more
important than the law , letha .
with these receptors
placed on certain people ,
combined with this boy 's powers ,
i could become one of the most
influential men in the world .
oh , you are absolutely
brilliant , professor .
now we can go ahead
with my plans , too .
do n't bother me with your plans .
they 're empty , unimportant .
a comment , perhaps , on you and
the life you 've been leading .
now , you look here ,
doctor , professor ,
physicist . whatever you are .
i built this laboratory
for you at great expense .
i used every penny i had .
now , we 've made a lot of plans
and i wo n't let you upset them .
i want some money . fast .
letha , we are worlds apart .
my mind is filled
with large concepts .
mankind , the universe .
you only worry about the horse
that 's running in the third race .
sure , i gamble ...
... but with my own money .
you 're the worst
kind of gambler .
you use other people 's money
and want to keep all
the winnings for yourself .
well , you can be sure
of one thing , victor .
i 'll be around to pick up
the chips with you .
we 'll be back in the morning
with maps and breakfast .
i 'll bring an egg
from my refrigerator .
and i 'll bring some
day-old bread .
i 'll bring some milk for you .
thank you .
you 're good friends .
that 's the trouble with us .
we do n't want to be good .
we want to be bad .
yeah .
hey , uh , let 's go , you guys .
my mom 's gon na yell at me .
see you tomorrow , tia .
we 'll find tony
tomorrow for sure .
let 's stay close
together on the way out , guys .
good .
this is professor gannon ...
... commanding you to awaken .
tony !
he 's in some kind of a room .
like a hospital .
with machines
and instruments and things .
oh , that 's easy .
all we have to do
is check all the hospitals .
while we going around
looking for a fight .
come on .
you will now function
exclusively under control .
you will no longer
think independently .
all thinking and reasoning
will be done
by the voice that commands you .
do you understand ?
yes .
what is your name ?
tony .
where are you from ?
witch mountain .
sounds like some hick town to me .
how did you suspend
mr. sickle in mid-air ?
by energizing matter .
do you mean to say that
you can control molecular flow ?
yes , sir .
how did you learn to do this ?
i was born with the ability .
i wish to see a demonstration
of molecular flow .
you are strapped to the table .
unbuckle yourself and sit up .
power has come into our hands
which is centuries
before its time .
we must use it wisely .
well , what can you have him do ?
other than go around making
people 's belts unbuckle .
the possibilities are unlimited .
oh , come on . it 's just
some gimmick , that 's all .
tony ...
mr. sickle , whose life you saved ,
does n't seem to believe in you .
mr. sickle needs convincing , tony .
hey , come on .
hey , get back !
get back ! get back !
do n't .
get back !
i can see how that 'd be a big
hit at a scientific convention .
but the bottom line is ,
how do we make money with it ?
i will demonstrate
an industrial application .
come with me , tony .
now , tony , those wine casks ...
stack them ... neatly .
two glasses of burgundy , please .
to molecular mobilization .
to molecular capitalization .
hey , got any more clues ?
no .
nothing at all . it 's so strange .
we 've been to every hospital
and he 's in none of them .
it 's like his mind 's a blank .
he probably conked out somewhere .
do n't listen to him .
we 'll find tony for sure .
yeah , we 'll turn
the town upside down .
yeah .
what 're you doing ?
thinking .
thinking about us in
a different place , such as ...
las vegas ...
... with tony .
seven or eleven every time , right ?
a day at the races .
all the long shots
come in .
you do have
an imagination , after all .
the possibilities
with tony are unlimited .
for example , he stacked the wine
casks by just looking at them .
if he can stack them ,
he can unstack them .
the gold is on display
at the museum .
protected by an impenetrable
security system .
just sitting there
waiting for us ...
... to penetrate it .
wait a minute . us ?
you mean gannon said it 's ok
to use the control on tony ?
professor gannon is
extremely busy being a genius .
i own half the invention ,
half of tony , that means
i own half of the profits .
so far , the return on
my investment has been
half of zero .
what about security . we 'd
need an army to pull it off .
we 'll have an army with us !
tony .
tony ?
tony ?
tony , why ca n't i
get through to you ?
tony ?
i 'll pick up the new
transistors , make a few stops .
be back later on .
do n't worry .
everything 's under control .
tony . this is letha wedge ,
commanding you to open your eyes .
now , stand up .
we 're going to the museum
for education and profit .
tony and i will do
a little ... sightseeing .
wait .
gold ! i see gold .
hey it 's mine .
where is it ?
hey , give it to me !
no !
a stagecoach .
she must be tuned in on a western .
yeah .
i see dummies .
that 's you .
no . old things .
clothing .
hey , he 's at the salvation army .
nah , they do n't got stagecoaches
at the salvation army .
they do n't got gold , neither .
wait a minute , wait a minute !
we had one of them
nothing school trips .
to the museum .
yeah , they got a pile of gold .
and a stagecoach .
they had to kick me out .
we 've got to go there .
come on , it 's over here .
now , tony .
we 're going to create
a little diversion .
the stagecoach .
i want you to roll it
all around the museum .
look out .
watch it .
watch out for that thing ,
it 's coming this way .
hey , where are the horses ?
i ... do n't know .
now cause total chaos .
watch out .
short circuit the control system .
oh , no .
letha !
letha !
look out .
get out of my way .
ca n't you put that thing out ?
come on , take a shot . move it .
now , tony ,
make a hole in the plastic shield .
and it does n't have to be neat .
tony , unstack the gold bars
and deliver them to mr. sickle .
move it buddy , move it .
we got ta get out of here !
las vegas , here we come .
look .
come on , follow me .
tony , make them go faster .
watch out !
hey , letha ! hey , letha !
look out , lady .
yeah , why do n't you watch where
you 're going , you big dummy .
look out , eddie !
tony , what 's happening ?
molecular flow reversing .
are you doing this ?
no .
then who is ?
it would have to be
one of my people .
there are more like you ?
yes .
let 's get out of here .
tony !
tony !
who 's that ?
it 's my sister .
my sister , tia .
this is no time
for a family reunion .
letha !
tony !
you fool ! how could you do this ?
not now .
what 's wrong ?
i do n't know .
i keep it running perfect .
it 's tony 's sister , she did it .
she 's as weird as he is .
tony , i command you to
make this car run perfectly
and continuously without
interference from your sister .
i ca n't stop the car .
tony 's energizing it .
it 's like your brother
does n't even know you .
it 's yo-yo . let 's go !
no . do n't run .
you crazy ? you do n't want
to go to that school .
please , trust me .
now , come on , hurry .
hey , wait for me .
come on , you guys .
get in there .
let 's go !
come on , get in .
i 'm dreaming .
you 're surrendering
to the board of education ?
sir , you see that car
going down the street ?
yeah .
my brother 's in it .
he ought to be going to school .
you ought to catch up with him .
another truant ? oh , boy ,
we 're gon na have a load .
hey , what happened ?
good driving , yo-yo .
yeah , that was neat .
this bus can really move .
tony , look through the window .
the rear window .
that minibus is following us .
i command you to place
obstacles in its path .
city property .
i 've damaged city property .
they said
these glasses were shatterproof .
was that a bus or a bridge ?
they 're still with us .
tony , you must stop her .
man , that man was really buzzing .
am i still alive ?
they 're gaining on us .
she counteracts
everything that tony does .
tony , you 've got to stop her .
we flew !
they must 've flown .
do n't you dare try it .
sickle ... sickle , stop ...
stop over that hill .
tony , cause the reflection
of the sun on the rear window
to magnify and
shine so brightly
that our pursuers 'll
be blinded by it .
come on , open the doors .
i ca n't see .
yeah .
come on , let me out .
everybody ok ?
yeah , sure .
oh , look what 's happened
to city property .
no ... but i 'm still
gon na take you to school .
just soon as i ...
come on .
you jeopardized my life 's work .
my accountants ' are desperate .
you 've proved yourself
incompetent yet again .
i do n't even know if
i can trust you anymore .
you do n't trust me ?
i trusted you enough
to make my credit rating
look like swiss cheese .
do n't tell me
you do n't trust me .
we have to trust each other .
right . i trust everybody .
yes ... well , fortunately ,
i thought of something
very spectacular
which will satisfy both of us
in terms of prestige and money .
well , you have the prestige ,
i 'll take the money .
but , before we celebrate
your return to sanity ,
we 'd better do something
about tony 's sister .
how did she know
we were at the museum ?
i ... i 'm not certain .
tony .
how did your sister know
that we were at the museum ?
telepathy .
she 'll show up again
and ruin everything .
in that case , she will
have to be , as you would say ...
... scratched ?
tia .
tia .
what happened to you ?
i ca n't explain now .
i 've lost the power to energize .
where are you ?
follow my voice path . please !
ok. guide me .
tony , which way ?
this way .
which way , tony ? which way ?
keep moving straight ahead .
this is the house .
here , look .
come on .
down here .
be quiet , alfred , you silly thing .
tia !
tony !
i 've put her into a state
of comatose neutralization .
hey , tia .
we got you some cold hotcakes .
she ai n't here .
hope she did n't go
looking for tony without us .
yeah , she needs us .
tony ? crusher ?
muscles ? rocky ?
dazzler ?
alfred .
alfred , what 's the matter with me ?
where am i ?
alfred , find the earthquakes .
listen to me .
what kind of place is that ?
that is an underground
plutonium processing plant .
translate that into financial terms .
plutonium is
more valuable than gold .
that 's why i like scientists .
they 're always discovering
new , expensive things .
it is used in the explosive core
of nuclear missile warheads .
i suppose you 're
going to have tony
split an atom bomb or something .
in effect ...
... yes
well , i did n't count on
killing anybody .
especially not us .
it will never go that far .
they will pay
anything to prevent it .
this is the first step
towards my becoming
the most powerful man
in the world .
ids , please .
take a powder .
tony .
those are the
outer security scanners .
put them out of commission ...
... permanently .
the scanning systems
are malfunctioning .
all right , let 's run
a maintenance check .
three million bucks , you 'd think
these things would work right .
where to ?
andy 's place , know it ?
yeah , sure . i know where
everything is . second and third ?
fourth and market .
that one .
hop in .
i 'm in a hurry . could you ...
do n't worry .
have you there
in a couple of minutes .
listen .
feel the power in this cab ?
it has lots of power .
you know , everybody tells me ,
i ought to be a race driver .
what do you think ?
well , i think you 're wrong .
do n't worry about nothing , sir .
i 'm a very safe driver .
want me to tell you how safe ?
i 'll tell you anyway .
i 've been driving a hack
for 19 years and 11 months .
and in all that time , i never
even put one scratch on a cab .
in fact , next month ,
they 're gon na give me
a gold safety award .
what do you think of that ?
boy , you do n't like nothing .
i sure hope you 're a good tipper .
i knew there was something about
you that did n't look right .
hey !
you owe me a fare !
officer , that goat 's a guy .
the goat ?
the guy became a goat
when i 'm driving .
the guy ?
this magician
beat me out of this fare .
the magician ?
my perfect record .
record ? oh ... record .
i ai n't gon na get
the gold safety award .
hear that ? that must be her .
come on .
help me .
hey . watch out .
get him away .
how 'd you get in here ?
hey , come on , get out of here .
watch out !
he 's looking at me
like he knows me .
hey , what do you want from me ?
get away !
he 's got tia 's vest .
get him !
quick .
we 're going for coffee now .
can i bring you a cup ?
may i see your ids , please ?
tony ?
show him our id .
what 's happening ?
why ?
do n't leave me up here .
open the door , tony .
you ca n't go in there
without ids .
now seal it .
how do i get down ?
tia !
quick , let 's get her out .
yeah .
phew , it smells .
it 's some kind of a gas .
come on .
you ok now ?
yes , thank you .
this is some kind of ...
... science place .
how 'd you get here ?
it was tony .
he was here .
i saw something !
what was it ?
it 's where tony is .
i 'm sure of it !
a big , round shape .
a doughnut !
he 's eating a doughnut .
no way !
is it like a ball ?
a great big ball ?
yes .
i know where he is .
let 's go !
hurry , let 's go .
oh , thank you .
and thanks for everything .
come on , let 's go .
we are about
to make scientific history .
and some money , too , i hope .
you will shut down the complete
cooling system of the furnace .
it 's a red light
on the cooling system .
it must be a circuit breaker .
restart the system .
i ca n't get a restart .
hit the backup system .
it 's no-go on backup .
temperature increasing
in the furnace .
get that coolant flowing .
furnace control .
control ?
you do n't really think you 're
controlling anything , do you ?
who is this ?
this is dr. victor gannon ,
and i have just shut down
your cooling system .
ok , you 've shut it down .
get it back on again !
tell him how expensive
it is to put it back on .
in exactly one hour , we shall be
serving grilled plutonium ,
medium rare , to the atmosphere
unless the following conditions are met .
what conditions ?
five million dollars in cash .
a jet waiting at the airport .
a safe escort , of course .
and most important of all ,
you will announce
that dr. victor gannon
has achieved molecular control
and mind control .
and this is the first of a series
of worldwide demonstrations of his power .
how long does it take
to count five million dollars ?
we 'll have to pay them .
evacuate the immediate area .
put los angeles on alert .
there 's the big round ball .
is that it ?
no , it was bigger than that .
get outta here .
leave me alone . at least i tried .
hey , look .
it 's yo-yo . let 's get out of here .
come on .
hey , yo-yo .
do n't you want to catch us ?
i do n't trust him .
he 's probably using
some psychology trick on us .
come on .
hey , mr. yo-yo ,
do n't you want to catch us ?
it 's not my job anymore .
they 're coming down to fire me ...
... for destroying city property .
the only thing that works is the
radio . and it wo n't turn off .
i was only trying to help you , kids .
mr. yokomoto ,
i 'm sorry about
everything that 's happened .
all i ever wanted in life
was all you kids that
i put back in school , someday ...
... visit me and say ,
`` thanks mr. yo-yo , yokomoto .
if it was n't for you
forcing us to get an education ,
we would 've been bums . ''
that 's all i wanted .
you see ?
i told you he was gon na ...
... hit us with
some of that heavy psychology .
i mean , i feel guilty .
bulletin from the plutonium plant .
unless the demands
of the terrorists are met ,
the furnace will explode
with the force of ten megatons .
an official describes
the atomic furnace controls
as frozen in position ,
as if `` the molecular flow ... ''
that 's tony !
the plant is being evacuated .
that 's where he is !
we 've got to go there .
how ? take a bus ?
we 'll go in this .
tia , the tires are flat .
come on .
if it does n't start cooling soon ,
the chain reaction will start .
you hear that ? in ten minutes ,
this place is going to be
a hole in the ground .
now , let 's be reasonable .
we have three and a half million
dollars in the control room .
and the balance is on the way .
it 's a deal .
i do not compromise .
hey , what are you guys doing ?
nothing ! nothing !
we 're doing nothing .
hey , kids !
how did these children
get past security ?
sir , the people destroying the
furnace kidnapped my brother .
if i could see him ,
i might stop them .
she can do it !
she can do it .
do what ?
impossible , they 're inside the room .
they 've sealed the door somehow .
what part has to be fixed ?
the emergency cooling system .
where is it ?
five levels down .
but it 's too late . we 've already
begun to evacuate the plant .
tony 's here , all right .
get me down .
thank you , thank you .
now , where are you going ?
in there .
oh , no . you ca n't go
beyond this point without ids .
tony !
tia !
i knew it .
she 'll spoil everything .
i can just taste that money .
we can not let her
take it away from us .
tony !
tony , from this moment
you will no longer hear tia .
she can not break through
my power of control .
acknowledge .
tony , what 's wrong ?
it 's me , your sister .
try to remember me .
acknowledge .
tony ?
yes , sir .
get those kids .
she 'll use some of those
molecules on us .
i 'll take care of her before
she gets a chance , you get them .
i ca n't get through .
i do n't know what
they 've done to his mind .
we 've got to find the emergency
cooling system ourselves .
how do you spell cooling ?
come on .
look out .
we 've got to find
the emergency switches .
you two go that way ,
and you two go that way .
tony , we must eliminate tia .
you will cause that portable
utility panel to run her down .
hey , tia , come here .
come on .
that ai n't it , right ?
you found it !
i knew it was it !
but , it 's spelt wrong .
you guys get
dazzler and muscles .
ok. come on .
the rest of the money 's
just arrived .
all right .
i 'd better call gannon .
the cooling system 's on .
switch it off .
we lost it !
what 's going on down there ?
it 's coming back .
gotcha !
tony , you must stop her .
tony , why are you
doing these things ?
why are you using
your powers against me ?
what 's happened ?
tony ...
... pretend to remember tia .
lure her to the
center of the room and ...
... make that crane drop on her .
tia !
i 'm starting to remember .
what was the matter with you ?
i do n't know , exactly ... but ...
i need help .
do n't go any closer .
why ? what is it , tony ?
tony , stop it !
stop it , tony , stop it !
exert a force
greater than hers .
why are you doing this , tony ?
stop .
crush her . kill her !
crush her !
crush her ! crush her !
finish her !
now !
tia .
where are we ?
what 's happened ?
tony .
tony , we can still do it .
we can still make use
of molecular control .
ok , doc , let 's do it .
letha !
why do n't we
all go and have some ...
some candy and , uh ,
sodas and ice cream ?
next time ...
... next time i 'll ...
forget it .
i 've lost my faith in science .
sickle !
aunt letha ! oh , aunt letha .

aunt letha ? aunt letha ?
it 's absolutely dreadful the way
they bring up children these days .
come on .
tony , the bus wo n't run
without me in it .
it 's all my fault .
it 's such a mess .
well , i guess we 'll
just have to fix it .
i 'm sure uncle bene wo n't mind .
i 'll do the engine .
you do the body work .
ok .
so long , alfie .
goodbye , alfred .
what job will you do now ,
mr. yo-yo , uh , yokomoto ?
oh , i 've saved my money .
i 'll probably open
a japanese delicatessen .
hey , kids , look .
i do n't understand this .
man !
wow , what a family .
the molecules must have
rearranged themselves ...
... somehow .
uh , that 's a possibility .
you know what this means ?
they never saw the wreck .
i 'll tell them that the reports
were exaggerated .
and , if you kids
will go back to school ,
i 'm sure they wo n't fire me .
you will go back to school ,
wo n't you ?
well , if we was
to go back to school ,
could we get as smart
as tia and tony ?
maybe even smarter .
yeah , sure .
let 's give it a shot .
great .
i hope the school can take it .
goodbye , yo-yo .
goodbye .
see you later , yo-yo .
you promised .
tia , open the gate .
no , everybody join hands .
cool !
all right !
flying saucer !
will we ever see you again ?
well , it 's ...
it 's kind of
hard to say .
thanks for everything .
and especially for
letting me be in your gang .
take care of alfred for me , ok ?
there you are .
where 's your luggage ?
uh , we lost it .
there were a few problems .
but you did have fun ?
oh , terrible .
i just knew we
should have gone surfing .

tia and tony taught us .
yeah .

hey , yo-yo !
yo-yo !

tia and tony just drove off
in a flying saucer .
flying saucer ?
how about whooshing
yourself into the bus ?

do miraculous things .
i believe anything and
everything , except that . get in .
